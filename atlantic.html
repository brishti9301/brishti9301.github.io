      <p>FOR CENTURIES THE Atlantic Ocean has been a key avenue of trade and travel. Stretching from the Arctic Circle to Antarctica, the Atlantic Ocean is bordered by the Americas to the west and Europe and Africa to the east.</p>
      <p>It's more than 41 million square miles, the second-largest ocean on Earth after the Pacific Ocean.</p>
      <p>Scientists and geographers broadly separate the Atlantic in terms of north and south. The North Atlantic and South Atlantic each have distinct ocean currents that influence weather around the world.</p>

      <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-60"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Water Currents and Gyres</span></h5>
      <p>The ocean doesn't sit still like water in a sink. It moves more like a conveyer belt that's driven by changes in temperature and salinity over large areas. Both quick-moving surface currents and slower-moving deep ocean currents circulate water around the globe.</p>
      <p>The seawater is constantly trying to find a balance. Warm water is less dense than cold water, so as water cools, it sinks, and warm water replaces it. Water with high salinity—more salt—also moves into waters with lower salinity. Those factors drive the conveyer belt, a process also called thermohaline circulation.</p>
      <p>Warm water is heated by the Gulf Stream, a warm air current that originates in the Gulf of Mexico. The warm water then moves north, where it forces cooler water to sink and move south. As the current moves toward Antarctica, upwelling pushes cold water back to the surface, pushing the watery conveyer belt around the world. Scientists estimate that it takes the conveyer belt about 500 years to make one trip.</p>

      <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Hurricanes</span></h5>
      <p>Without Africa's Sahara Desert, few hurricanes would strike the eastern coast of North America. That's because a wind stream called the African Easterly Jet is formed from the difference in the Sahara's dry, hot air and the humid cooler air to the west and south. The jet pushes westerly winds over Africa's west coast, where they sometimes pick up ocean water and form thunderstorms.</p>
      <p>Hurricanes are fueled by warm waters, and warmer Sahara summer winds drive some of the biggest hurricanes seen in the U.S. Those that form off the coast of Africa must survive wind shear (horizontal winds) to hit the East Coast with full force.</p>
      <p>Occasionally, as with Hurricanes Florence and Harvey, storms weaken as they make their way across the Atlantic Ocean but are then refueled by warm waters off the East Coast or in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

      <p>The Atlantic Ocean is home to a diverse array of sea life, both those we can observe at the surface, and those all but hidden from human eyes.</p>
      <p>In December 2018, National Geographic published photos from a deep-sea dive led by ocean research group OceanX. Images revealed the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, a federally protected marine area off the coast of Massachusetts, and it is teeming with biodiversity. A variety of corals, fish, and mollusks were found more than 3,000 feet below the sea.</p>
      <p>Many other well-known species live in the Atlantic, from dolphins to sea turtles.</p>
      <p>After decades of decline, scientists are finding that great white shark populations are growing in U.S. waters. The big fish feed on pinnipeds like seals that are typically found close to shore. Despite widespread fear of the species—heightened by pop culture’s treatment of it—scientists praise the return of great whites as a conservation success story. Recent studies are showing great whites may be venturing farther north near Maine and even as far north as New Brunswick, Canada.</p>
      <p>The North Atlantic right whale is steadily heading toward extinction. Just over 400 remain in the wild. The whale earned its name in the early 20th century from hunters who considered it the “right” whale to catch. In the past few years, the whales have been found dead in Canada's Gulf of St. Lawrence from what necropsies show are likely ship strikes. Scientists are also concerned that females, potentially facing environmental stress, are not reproducing at a rate fast enough to rebound the declining population.</p>
